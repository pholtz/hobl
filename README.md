This is a simple OpenGL first person simulation of the House of Blue Leaves from Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol. 1 (2003).

//////////// Required Libraries  ///////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////
FreeGLUT the OpenGL window management package we will be using. The package is targetted to Linux, but you can get a distribution for Windows (this package will also work on VS 2013).
SOIL the Simple OpenGL Image Library package we will be using. I have precompiled libraries for Windows and Mac OSX that can be downloaded in the corresponding installation section below.
GLEW the OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library package we will be using for shaders (since Windows contains an old version of OpenGL). NOTE: OSX contains a current version of OpenGL and thus does not require GLEW.

I used Visual Studio 2013 to create this project, but it is by no means necessary to run the program.
