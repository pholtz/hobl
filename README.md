This is a simple OpenGL first person simulation of the House of Blue Leaves from Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol. 1 (2003).

_Required Libraries_

FreeGLUT: the OpenGL window management package.
SOIL: the Simple OpenGL Image Library.
GLEW: the OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library.

I used Visual Studio 2013 to create this project, but it is by no means necessary to run the program.
